This program controls the built-in LED on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W using Python fundamentals:
- Variables (int, float, str, bool) to store light settings
- Arithmetic operations to calculate light patterns  
- Conditionals (if/else) to control LED behavior
- String operations for professional output

Your task: Complete the TODOs below to create a working smart light controller.
