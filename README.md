# Lab 2: IoT Hardware Introduction - Smart Light Controller
**CMPSC 100: Computational Expression Fall 2025**

## Meet Your Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W

The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** is a powerful microcontroller that brings the physical world into your programming experience. Unlike a regular computer, this tiny board is designed to interact directly with electronic components like LEDs, sensors, and motors.

### How the Pico 2 W Works

The Pico 2 W operates on **3.3 volts** of electricity and contains:
- **GPIO pins** (General Purpose Input/Output) that can send electrical signals to control LEDs or read sensor data
- A **wireless chip** for WiFi connectivity, enabling true IoT functionality
- **Flash memory** to store your Python programs permanently
- A **dual-core processor** running at 150MHz to execute your code

When you write code to control an LED, you're actually telling the Pico to send a **3.3V electrical signal** through specific pins. LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) work by allowing current to flow in one direction, converting electrical energy into light. The built-in LED on your Pico 2W can be controlled using the `"LED"` pin identifier through MicroPython commands.

This direct hardware control is what makes microcontrollers different from regular computers - your code immediately affects the physical world through electricity and electronic components.

## Overview

Welcome to your introduction to physical computing and IoT hardware! In Lab 1, you mastered Python fundamentals including variables, data types, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, input/output, and basic conditionals using a sensor simulation. Now in Lab 2, you'll apply those same programming concepts, with the addition of conditionals, to control actual hardware with the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.

This lab transitions you from simulation to reality by introducing you to the hardware, development environment, and MicroPython programming. You will create a **Smart Light Controller** that actually controls the built-in LED on your Pico 2 W and displays system information using the Python skills you've already learned.

By the end of this lab, you will have a working physical light controller that responds to your programming - bridging the gap between the software concepts from Lab 1 and the IoT systems you'll build throughout the semester.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Set up the MicroPython development environment** in VS Code for physical IoT hardware control
2. **Apply Python programming fundamentals** from Lab 1 (variables, data types, arithmetic, conditionals) to control physical hardware
3. **Control actual hardware** by turning the Pico's built-in LED on and off through code
4. **Create structured output** using the print statement and string formatting skills from Lab 1
5. **Use basic conditionals** to control LED behavior based on program variables
6. **Bridge the gap** between software simulation (Lab 1) and physical IoT systems

**âœ… Success**: You should see "MicroPico" in the bottom status bar and a blinking green LED!

## Start Coding: Your First Hardware Program

**From Lab 1 to Lab 2**: In Lab 1, you used `print()` to display sensor simulation results. Now in Lab 2, you'll use the same programming concepts to control actual hardware!

**Ready to code?** Open `light_controller.py` and start applying your Lab 1 Python skills to control real hardware!

## The Lab Challenge: Smart Light Controller v2.0

**Building on Lab 1:** In Lab 1, you simulated sensor data using Python variables, calculations, and conditionals. Now you'll use those same programming concepts to control actual hardware!

**Important File Organization:**
- Keep all your code files in the GitHub repository folder you cloned
- The `light_controller.py` file is already provided as a starter
- Your work stays in your local repo and gets committed/pushed to GitHub
- The MicroPico extension runs files directly from your repo folder on the Pico

### Phase 1: Development Environment Setup (20 minutes)
*Complete this during the in-class session*

**Your environment should now be ready from the Getting Started steps above. Let's verify:**

1. **Open `light_controller.py`** from your repository folder
2. **Make sure your Pico 2 W is connected** and VS Code shows "MicroPico" in the status bar
3. **Test with `led_test.py`**: Run it to verify the green LED blinks

## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting

**LED not working?** 
- Make sure you use `Pin("LED", Pin.OUT)` (not Pin 25)
- Run `led_test.py` to verify your Pico LED works
- Look for the green LED on your Pico 2W board

**Connection issues?**
- Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) â†’ "MicroPico: Connect"
- Try "MicroPico: Disconnect" then "MicroPico: Connect"
- Make sure you installed **MicroPico by paulober**

**Need detailed setup help?** See `PICO_SETUP.md` for complete hardware and software setup instructions.

### How to Run Your Code

**Simple Steps:**
1. **Open** your `light_controller.py` file in VS Code
2. **Press** `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open Command Palette
3. **Type** "MicroPico: Run current file" and select it
4. **Watch** the output in VS Code terminal AND the LED on your Pico!

**Alternative**: Click the â–¶ button in the top-right corner when viewing .py files

**Your code files stay in your GitHub repository folder** - the MicroPico extension runs them directly on the Pico.

### Phase 2: Smart Light Control with Python Fundamentals (45 minutes)
*Begin in class, complete outside of class*

You will build a Smart Light Controller that applies the Python concepts from Lab 1 to control physical hardware. Your system needs to demonstrate:

**Lab 1 Skills Applied to Hardware:**

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Use the same variable types from Lab 1 to store light settings:
   - `int` variables for brightness levels and blink counts  
   - `float` variables for timing measurements
   - `str` variables for user/room names and status messages
   - `bool` variables for LED state (True/False)

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Use calculations similar to Lab 1's sensor analysis:
   - Convert brightness percentage to practical values (like Lab 1's temperature conversion)
   - Calculate total blink cycles and timing (like Lab 1's time calculations)
   - Determine timing intervals and performance metrics (like Lab 1's averages)

3. **String Operations**: Apply Lab 1's string skills for hardware status:
   - String concatenation for device IDs and status messages
   - `.upper()` method for professional status displays (like Lab 1)
   - String formatting for hardware reports

4. **Conditionals**: Use `if` statements to control hardware based on variables:
   - `if led_state:` to turn LED on or off
   - `if blink_cycles >= 1:` to create simple blink patterns
   - Multiple `if` statements to create different LED behaviors
   - Conditional logic for system status determination (no loops needed!)

**Note**: This lab intentionally uses only conditionals and basic statements (no loops) to keep the focus on applying Lab 1 skills to hardware. Loops will be introduced in Lab 3!

**Physical Hardware Control**: Your program will actually turn the built-in LED on and off, demonstrating how Lab 1's programming concepts control real hardware!

### Phase 3: System Documentation and Testing (25 minutes)
*Complete outside of class*

1. **Code Documentation**: Add comprehensive comments explaining:
   - Purpose of each variable and calculation
   - How the environmental assessments work
   - What each section of output represents

2. **Data Validation**: Create additional variables to:
   - Check if readings are within realistic ranges
   - Calculate data quality indicators
   - Show system confidence levels

3. **Testing Different Scenarios**: Modify your light settings to test:
   - Different brightness levels and see the LED respond
   - Various blink speeds and patterns
   - Different numbers of blink cycles
   - Watch how changing variables affects the physical LED behavior

**Important**: You are now controlling actual hardware! The built-in LED on your Pico will physically turn on and off based on your program settings.
